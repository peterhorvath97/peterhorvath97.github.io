## Research Interest

Applied econometrics, empirical macroeconomics, machine learning methods. 
Currently, I am working on natural language processing applications in monetary policy analysis.

## Previous Positions and Research Experiences

- *Summer Research Intern* -- International Monetary Fund (2023)
	- My projectwas titled “Monetary transmission in a fragmented uncertainworld” in the Strategy, Policy, and Review department’s Macro Policy division. In this paper we investigated how economic uncertainty impacts the monetary transmission mechanism using Threshold VAR models estimated with sign restrictions across various countries. We found that in times of high uncertainty, monetary shocks are followed by a larger and longer-lasting contraction of output, than in normal times. However, our results show no significant difference in the reaction of inflation rates, indicating that uncertainty increases the cost of reducing inflation. Our results also suggest that more extreme levels of uncertainty amplify this effect.
